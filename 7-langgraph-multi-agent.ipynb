    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to build and deploy LLM (Large Language Model) agents using LLama3 and LangGraph. These agents will be capable of processing natural language inputs, generating comprehensive plans, and handling complex workflows. By the end of this notebook, you will understand how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up and configure a language model using LLama3.\n",
    "2. Define and manage the state for agents in a workflow.\n",
    "3. Implement and customize agent classes for specific tasks.\n",
    "4. Construct and compile a workflow graph using LangGraph.\n",
    "5. Execute the workflow and handle outputs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to understand some basic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model):** A machine learning model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. LLama3 is an example of such a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent:** A software component that interacts with the LLM to perform specific tasks, such as generating responses or processing information. In this notebook, we implement agents that can handle various aspects of a workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State:** A shared data structure that stores the context and data required by agents. The state is critical for maintaining continuity and passing information between different parts of the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Workflow Graph:** A structured representation of the workflow, where nodes represent agents and edges define the flow of information and control. LangGraph is used to construct and manage these workflow graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering:** The process of crafting prompts that guide the LLM's responses. Proper prompt engineering is crucial for ensuring the model generates relevant and accurate outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts will provide a solid foundation as we proceed with the practical implementation of LLM agents and workflows in this notebook."

      "As the head of the government of the United States, the president is arguably the most powerful government official in the world. The president is elected to a four-year term via an electoral college system. Since the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951, the American presidency has been limited to a maximum of two terms. Kamala Harris (born October 20, 1964, Oakland, California, U.S.) is the 49th vice president of the United States (2021-25) in the Democratic administration of Pres. Joe Biden.She was the first woman, the first Black American, and the first Asian American to hold the post.She had previously served in the U.S. Senate (2017-21) and as attorney general of California (2011-17). Potential Democratic challengers to Vice President Kamala Harris were quiet about their plans after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election. Harris Harris 46%. Trump Trump 48%. About this data. Note: Individual poll results are shown as circles for each candidate. Polls with greater weight in the average have larger circles. Source ... Since 1789 and the election of George Washington, America's first president, 45 individuals have served as the chief executive of the United States (Grover Cleveland was elected for two nonconsecutive terms, so he served as the 22nd and 24th president).\u001b[0m\n",
