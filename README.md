# LLM and Agents Tutorials

This repository contains a series of tutorials on how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) and agents, specifically focusing on the LangChain library. Each tutorial is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, guiding you through various concepts and practical applications. The goal is to help you understand and implement AI agents capable of processing and generating human-like text.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to introduce you to LangChain, a powerful tool for building applications using large language models (LLMs). LangChain helps developers create applications that can perform various tasks by understanding and processing human language.

### What You'll Learn

- **What is LangChain?**  
  Learn about the library and its capabilities in leveraging LLMs for various applications.

- **What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?**  
  Understand the basics of LLMs and how they can generate human-like text.

- **What is an Agent in AI?**  
  Explore the concept of AI agents and their applications in real-world scenarios.

- **Setting Up a LangChain Agent**  
  Step-by-step guide on creating an agent using Python.

- **Handling Errors in Agent Responses**  
  Techniques for managing and troubleshooting errors in agent interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `langchain`: Core library for creating and managing agents.
- `langchain-ollama`: Extension for integrating specific language models.
- `langchain-community`: Utilities and tools for working with LangChain.
- `numexpr`: A fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.

### Installation

You can install the necessary libraries using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-ollama langchain-community numexpr
```

### Running the Notebooks

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained. You can run them in sequence or pick the ones relevant to your interests. They are structured to gradually increase in complexity, starting from simple concepts and moving towards more advanced implementations.
